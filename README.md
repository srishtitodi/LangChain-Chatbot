# LangChain-Chatbot
In this project, I have created a chatbot using Langchain framework on GPT-3.5. This chatbot is specialised in research papers and can answer questions on them. In the LangChain Research Bot file, I have mentioned a detailed step-by-step framework using a few research files. 

In the LangChain Research Bot Dashboard file, I have shown the pipeline at a go along with a dashboard with the chatbot for interaction with the user. The user can also see the Database and the Chat History of the interaction. I have used Panel and Param to create the same. 

An example of the dashboard has been uploaded in the Research Bot.png file.
